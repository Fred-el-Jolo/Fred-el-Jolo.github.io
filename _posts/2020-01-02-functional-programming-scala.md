## What is functional programming
### Referentiel transparency
An expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p, all occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of p.

A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent x.

### Substitution model
Consists in replacing all variables with their referents and reduce the function to its simplest form.

### Benefits
- Better modularity:
   - Local reasoning: Simply look at the function's definition and substitute arguments into its body.
   - composable
