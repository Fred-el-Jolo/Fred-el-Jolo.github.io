## Proof

Proper mathematical proof:
1. Clear & precise statement of what you are trying to prove
2. Set of assumptions which are taken to be true
3. Chain of reasonning takes you from the assumptions to the statement you are trying to prove
4. QED

Algorithmic notations: 
- English
- Pseudo code
- Real programming language

Heart of an algorithm is an idea. This idea must be clearly revealed when the algorithm is expressed.

Problem specification: 
- Set of allowed  input instances
- Required properties of the algorithm's output

Counter-examples to demonstrate incorrectness

Develop counter-examples hunting skill:
- Think small
- Think exhaustively
- Hunt for the weakness
- Go for a tie
- Seek extremes
